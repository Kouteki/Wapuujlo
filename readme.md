Wapuujlo

This is the PDF vector file of Wapuujlo, created by Nemanja Aleksic and Milica Spasojevic.

A mascot for WordCamp Belgrade, Wapuujlo wears a traditional Serbian hat "sajkaca" and hugs a plum, one of the principal fruits of the region which symbolizes prosperity. Even the name Wapuujlo has been made to sound Serbian.
